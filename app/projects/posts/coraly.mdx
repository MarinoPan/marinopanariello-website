# Overview

For Lasting Dynamics I designed Coraly, a SaaS platform that lets sales teams orchestrate bespoke pipelines. The objective was to simplify activity management without sacrificing analytical depth or configurability.

## Kanban board

The board view keeps opportunities readable at every funnel stage. Compact cards, visual indicators, and quick actions support prioritisation and real-time collaboration.

## Table view

For high-volume analysis, the table offers multi-filters, grouping, and custom columns. Users can jump from crisp overviews to granular reads without losing context.

## Seller hierarchy

A native hierarchy provides visibility into team and individual performance. It becomes easy to track progress, assign responsibilities, and manage territories in a few clicks.

## Sales card

While creating a card, the form captures contextual information: contacts, notes, included products, and next actions. Every field is designed to keep data consistent throughout the process.

## Custom start form

Admins can define templates and fields tailored to different markets or teams. This provides flexibility without compromising the quality of captured data.
