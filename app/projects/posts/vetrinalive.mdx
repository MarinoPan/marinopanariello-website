# Overview

For VetrinaLive, a Lasting Dynamics product, I designed the entire experience: design system, core flows, and the marketing site delivery on WordPress. The goal was to provide an immediate alternative to Shopifyâ€”simple to manage and commission free.

## Dashboard

The dashboard aggregates KPIs, sales, and notifications in real time. Charts and dynamic cards help merchants act quickly on promotions and inventory.

## Product management

Grid and list layouts with key metadata always in view keep the catalog under control. Filters and batch actions reduce maintenance time.

## Orders and fulfilment

The orders section supports advanced filters, shipping management, and customer communication, bringing everything into a single view.

## Store personalization

Every merchant can configure themes, payments, and shipping without writing code. Settings are split into tabs to keep cognitive load low.

## Online shop experience

The public interface highlights product imagery, variants, and fast calls to action, all optimized for mobile. The work included interactive prototypes to validate purchase flows and storytelling.
