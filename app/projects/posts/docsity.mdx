# Overview

At Docsity I led the evolution of the user experience in close partnership with product and engineering stakeholders. The work focused on interface consistency and smoother flows for students and content creators.

## Measurable impact

- +137% document views directly from the new dashboard
- +43% revenue generated by the main journey
- +56% subjects added to user profiles

## Dashboard redesign

The dashboard moved from a dense, low-hierarchy layout to a clear surface that highlights primary actions. Calls to action and indicators were rebalanced to support faster, more informed decisions.

## Homepage evolution

The homepage now communicates the value of the community and makes exploration easier. Custom illustrations, emphasis on uploads and discovery, and contextual messaging keep the interface empathetic and action oriented.

## Documentation workflow

I built a library of utility components and a ready-to-use kit for presentations and mockups. The refreshed workflow makes content production linear, encouraging clear storytelling and consistent assets across every touchpoint.
