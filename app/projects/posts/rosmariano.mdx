# Overview

Alongside Lasting Dynamics I helped design Rosmariano, a project that turns virtual farming into tangible sustainable impact. The application blends play-to-earn mechanics with crypto wallets and traditional payments.

## Interactive map

The primary screen is a living map that shows growth stages and available actions. Each area reveals progress and resources, guiding players to optimise their harvest.

## Integrated wallet

Deposits and withdrawals in cryptocurrency happen directly in the app through the MetaMask integration. Rewards earned in-game can be converted or reinvested with zero friction.

## Sferografia progression

The "Sferografia" progression system unlocks skills and power-ups. Abilities earned affect both virtual production and the linked sustainability initiatives.
