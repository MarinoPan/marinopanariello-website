# Overview

For Diagnostic Biochips, a US company focused on electrophysiology, I collaborated with the Lasting Dynamics team on an integrated suite: desktop app, web app, and admin panel. The goal was to stabilise the platform, modernise the interface, and lift operational efficiency (+83% in data processing).

## Dashboard redesign

The redesign introduced clearer signal mapping, more legible layouts, and configurable widgets. Researchers can now move from aggregated overviews to granular insights without losing context.

## Advanced data analysis

- **Widget organisation:** customise selection and layout to isolate units, correlations, and waveforms.
- **ClusterView and FeatureView:** dedicated views to compare chip characteristics and behaviour in real time.
- **WaveForm View:** filterable timelines to monitor amplitude, frequency, and spikes.

## Outcome

The new experience reduces human error, accelerates lab workflows, and makes historically complex datasets accessible through consistent desktop and web interfaces.
